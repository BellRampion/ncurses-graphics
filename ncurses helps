-----What to do when ncurses doesn't appear to be working-----

====LAST UPDATED: 6/26/17====

--Necessary parts of an ncurses-including program:
    **Include the -lncurses flag when compiling
    **Include <curses.h>
    **Put (void) initscr(); before the rest of the ncurses code
    **Put endwin(); at the end of all ncurses code

--Some tips:
    **Refresh the screen after making changes.
    **When printing, call getch() after each print to keep the screen from moving on too fast. Getch() asks for user input. 
    **Move() won't let you move a cursor off the screen. If the cursor stays in the left-hand corner, then you tried to move it too far. A full-sized terminal in Ubuntu 16.04 is only ~42 y-coordinates long and 149 x-coordinates wide. 
    **Move() puts the y coordinate before the x (e.g.: move(y, x)).
